create an html whiteboard
any user drawing will appear on all connected clients

design:
    communication
        user commands will be sent to server
        server broadcast to all clients except the source
        start with a simple stateless broadcast, so newly joined clients won't have history data
        
        use socket.io as the communication lib
        optionally use batching, to avoid IO for each point
    serialization
        commands supported
            [(start pt, end pt, color), ]. This is a peice-wise line representation. 
                It is more costly, but the server won't need to find stroke context of incoming points
                multiple points may be batched
                Client side is also simplified when render receiving strokes
            (new drawing)
        
    client drawing
        coordiantes
            need to send normalized coordiantes to server, to avoid screen sizes mismatch
        render
            as it receives peice-wise line, it needs to call these for every point (beginPath, moveTo, lineTo, stroke)
